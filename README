ÂµHTTP for C++ is a developer framework for HTTP client and server applications. The framework was forked from CyberLink for C++ v1.7.2 except the UPnP and SOAP functions. 

CyberLink for C++  was developing for embedded platforms, but I will improve the framework for enterprise platforms in the future :-)
