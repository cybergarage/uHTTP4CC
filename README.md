# µHTTP for C++

µHTTP for C++ is a developer framework for HTTP client and server applications. The framework was forked from [mUPnP for C++](https://github.com/cybergarage/mupnp-cc) v1.7.2 except the UPnP and SOAP functions.

[mUPnP for C++](https://github.com/cybergarage/mupnp-cc) was developing for embedded platforms, but I will improve the framework for enterprise platforms in the future.

## Examples

As sample applications using µHTTP for C++, the package has some simple examples. [httpget](https://github.com/cybergarage/uhttp-cc/tree/master/examples/httpget) and [fsserver](https://github.com/cybergarage/uhttp-cc/tree/master/examples/fsserver). The [httpget](https://github.com/cybergarage/uhttp-cc/tree/master/examples/httpget) a simple HTTP client application like curl utility. The [fsserver](https://github.com/cybergarage/uhttp-cc/tree/master/examples/fsserver) is a simple HTTP server application to return file contents in the specified local directory.
